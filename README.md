# Datacamp-Introduction to Data Visualization with Matplotlib
 Visualizing data in plots and figures exposes the underlying patterns in the data and provides insights. This course is all about matplotlib library.  In this course, I have learned how to use Matplotlib, a powerful Python visualization library to visualize the data effectively.


This course is divided into four chapters. This chapters are-

1. **Introduction to Matplotlib**
    - Using the _matplotlib.pyplot_ interface
    - Adding data to an axes object
    - Customizing plots
    - Customizing data appearance
    - Customizing axis labels and adding titles
    - Small Multiples
    - Creating small multiples with plt.subplots
    - Small multiples with shared **y** axis

2. **Plotting Time-Series**
    - Plotting the time-series data
    - Read data with a time-series object
    - Plot time-series data
