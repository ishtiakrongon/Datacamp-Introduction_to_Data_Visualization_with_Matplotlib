# Datacamp-Introduction to Data Visualization with Matplotlib
 Visualizing data in plots and figures exposes the underlying patterns in the data and provides insights. This course is all about matplotlib library.  In this course, I have learned how to use Matplotlib, a powerful Python visualization library to visualize the data effectively.


This course is divided into four chapters. This chapters are-

1. **Introduction to Matplotlib**
    - Using the _matplotlib.pyplot_ interface
    - Adding data to an axes object
    - Customizing plots
    - Customizing data appearance
    - Customizing axis labels and adding titles
    - Small Multiples
    - Creating small multiples with plt.subplots
    - Small multiples with shared **y** axis

2. **Plotting Time-Series**
    - Plotting the time-series data
    - Read data with a time-series object
    - Plot time-series data
    - Using a time index to zoom in
    - Plotting time-series with different variables
    - Plotting two variables
    - Defining a function that plots time-series data
    - Using a plotting function
    - Annotating time-series data
    - Annotating a plot of time-series data
    - Plotting time-series: putting it all together

3. **Quantitative Comparisons and Statistical Visualizations**
    - Quantitative comparisons: bar-charts
    - Bar chart
    - Stacked bar chart
    - Quantitative comparisons: histograms
    - Creating histograms
    - "Step" histogram
    - Statistical plotting
    - Adding error-bars to a bar chart
    - Adding error-bars to a plot
    - Creating boxplots
    - Quantitative comparisons: scatter plots
    - Simple scatter plot
    - Encoding time by color

4. **Sharing Visualizations with Others**
    - Preparing your figures to share with others
    - Switiching betweenm styles
    - Saving visualizations
    - Saving a file several times
    - Save a figure with different sizes
    - Automating figures with different sizes
    - Unique values of a column
    - Automate your visualization
